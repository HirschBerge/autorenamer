# Autorenamer

## Why?

To help myself learn rust. I decided to rewrite my [bash autorenamer]() in Rust. I have learned that I am already better than ChatGPT at writing code that works the first time. But that's not saying much...

## What?

This is purely a hypothetical need. I do not partake in, or condone piracy (except maybe against 'Big N'). I have found the need to rename files generated by [Ani-Cli](https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli) to the Plex naming schema. This completes that.

## Usage

### Create sim-link to directory that's in $PATH

`sudo ln -s /path/to/compiled/binary $HOME/.local/bin`

### Running

```
autorenamer --help
Rust Autorenamer 

USAGE:
    autorenamer [OPTIONS] --season <SEASON>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -p, --path <DIRECTORY>    Specify the path (optional, defaults to current directory)
    -s, --season <SEASON>     Specify the season as a digit.
```
