# Autorenamer

## Why?

To help myself learn rust. I decided to rewrite my [bash autorenamer](https://github.com/HirschBerge/Scripts/blob/NixOS_Dekstop_Wayland/autorenamer.sh) in Rust. I have learned that I am already better than ChatGPT at writing code that works the first time. But that's not saying much...

## What?

This is purely a hypothetical need. I do not partake in, or condone piracy (except maybe against 'Big N'). I have found the need to rename files generated by [Ani-Cli](https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli) to the Plex naming schema. This completes that.

## Usage

### Create sim-link to directory that's in $PATH

`sudo ln -s /path/to/compiled/binary $HOME/.local/bin`

### Running

```
autorenamer --help
Rust Autorenamer 

USAGE:
    autorenamer [OPTIONS] --season <SEASON>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -p, --path <DIRECTORY>    Specify the path (optional, defaults to current directory)
    -s, --season <SEASON>     Specify the season as a digit.

EXAMPLE:
autorenamer --season 1 --path ~/Videos/Anime/Monogatari\ Series/Season\ 1\ Bakemonogatari
```
### People love to talk about how fast Rust is. 

Compared to my bash script, testing on directories with 30,000 empty files to rename, Bash came in at 35 seconds. Not bad. That's a lot of files. This, using rust, on the other hand. Took a whopping.... well `autorenamer --season 1  0.82s user 0.44s system 99% cpu 1.276 total`
