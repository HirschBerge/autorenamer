# Autorenamer

## Why?

To help myself learn rust. I decided to rewrite my [bash autorenamer](https://github.com/HirschBerge/Scripts/blob/NixOS_Dekstop_Wayland/autorenamer.sh) in Rust. I have learned that I am already better than ChatGPT at writing code that works the first time. But that's not saying much...

## What?

This is purely a hypothetical need. I do not partake in, or condone piracy (except maybe against 'Big N'). I have found the need to rename files generated by [Ani-Cli](https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli) to the Plex naming schema. This completes that.

## Usage

### Create sim-link to directory that's in $PATH

`sudo ln -s /path/to/compiled/binary $HOME/.local/bin`

### Running

```bash
Video file renamer for library management

Usage:
  > autorenamer {flags} ...(args)

Flags:
  -s, --season <int>: Season of the show to rename
  -p, --path <string>: Path to the directory containing your season
  -o, --offset <int>: An integer with a positive or negative number to offset renaming by. i.e. --ofset 5 changes 'Episode 5.mp4' to 'Episode 10.mp4'
  -d, --dryrun: Shows the 'whatif' events without actually writing changes to disk
  -h, --help: Print help
  -V, --version: Print version

Parameters:
  ...args <external-argument>: all other arguments to the command
```
